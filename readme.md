# gclone

A simple and convenient CLI tool to streamline the GitHub repository cloning process. `gclone` allows you to clone repositories with shorter commands and provides additional features like automatically opening projects in VSCode and managing a temporary project directory.

## Features

- üöÄ Quick clone with shortened commands
- üìÇ Default username configuration
- üíª Optional VSCode integration
- üìÅ Temporary directory management
- ‚öôÔ∏è User-configurable settings

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/setsudan/gclone/releases).

2. Add the executable to your system's PATH:
   - Windows: Move `gclone.exe` to a directory in your PATH (e.g., `C:\Users\YourUsername\bin\`)
   - Linux/MacOS: Move `gclone` to `/usr/local/bin/` or another directory in your PATH

3. Run the configuration:

```bash
gclone -config
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Clone your own repository (uses configured username)
gclone myrepo

# Clone from specific user/organization
gclone kubernetes/kubernetes
```

### Advanced Features

```bash
# Clone and open in VSCode
gclone -c myrepo

# Clone to temporary directory
gclone -tmp myrepo

# Combine flags
gclone -c -tmp myrepo
```

### Configuration

```bash
# Run initial setup or update configuration
gclone -config
```

The configuration will prompt you for:

- Your default GitHub username
- Custom temporary directory path (optional)

Configuration is stored in `~/.gclone/config.json`:

```json
{
  "default_username": "yourusername",
  "tmp_directory": "C:\\Dev\\tmp"
}
```

## Requirements

- Git installed and accessible in PATH
- VSCode installed and `code` command available in PATH (only for `-c` flag)
- Write permissions for temporary directory creation

```bash
# Clone your repository 'awesome-project'
